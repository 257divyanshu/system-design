Nice — let’s deep-dive. I’ll explain each concept clearly, show how they connect, give practical commands / mini-labs you can run, and finish with next steps and exercises. Ready? Here we go.

# Public vs Private IPs

**✅ What they are (short)**

* **Public IP**: routable on the global Internet. Assigned by your ISP or cloud provider. Any device on the Internet can (in principle) send packets to it.
* **Private IP**: non-routable on the public Internet; used inside local networks. Routers/NAT hide these addresses from the Internet.

**⏩ Common ranges (RFC1918 & others)**

* `10.0.0.0/8` → 10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255
* `172.16.0.0/12` → 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255
* `192.168.0.0/16` → 192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255
  Other special addresses: loopback `127.0.0.1/8`, link-local `169.254.0.0/16` (APIPA), IPv6 unique local `fc00::/7`.

**⏩ How private + public IPs work together (NAT/PAT)**

* **NAT (Network Address Translation)** lets many private hosts share a single public IP.
* **PAT** (port translation) maps many private:port pairs to a single public:port (what most home routers do).
* For a laptop to be reachable from Internet you need either:

  * A real public IP on the laptop; or
  * Port forwarding on your router to your laptop; or
  * A cloud proxy or VPN (or use a reverse tunnel / ngrok / dynamic DNS).

**✅ Static vs Dynamic public IPs**

* **Static**: IP doesn’t change — useful for servers. Cloud providers offer “elastic” or static IPs (AWS Elastic IP).
* **Dynamic**: ISP assigns via DHCP and it can change (typical home broadband).

**⏩ Security implications**

* Exposing a device with a public IP increases attack surface — firewall, updates, and proper hardening required.
* Private IPs + NAT provide an additional layer of isolation (not a substitute for a firewall).

**⏩ Practical mini-labs**

* On Linux / macOS: `ip addr` or `ifconfig` to see private IPs; `curl ifconfig.me` (or `curl icanhazip.com`) to see your public IP.
* On your router admin page, look for WAN IP (public) vs LAN IP ranges (private).
* Try port forwarding: host a simple Python HTTP server `python -m http.server 8000` and forward router port 8000 to your laptop’s private IP — test reachability from a different network (mobile data).

# DNS Resolution (deep)

**✅ What DNS is**
* A distributed, hierarchical directory that maps human-friendly domain names (e.g., `example.com`) to IP addresses (A/AAAA records) and stores many other records (CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, SOA, etc.).

**⏩ Common DNS record types (quick reference)**

* `A` — IPv4 address
* `AAAA` — IPv6 address
* `CNAME` — canonical name (alias)
* `NS` — authoritative nameserver for a zone
* `SOA` — start of authority (zone metadata)
* `MX` — mail exchanger
* `TXT` — arbitrary text (DKIM, SPF, verification)
* `SRV` — service locator

**✅ Components in resolution**

* **Stub resolver**: runs on the client (OS/browser) and asks a recursive resolver.
* **Recursive resolver**: typically your ISP or a public resolver (Google 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1). It does the work of walking the DNS tree.
* **Root servers**: 13 logical root server clusters (`.`) that point to TLD servers.
* **TLD servers**: responsible for `.com`, `.org`, `.in`, etc. They point to authoritative nameservers for the domain.
* **Authoritative nameserver**: the final source for a domain’s records.

**✅ Step-by-step resolution (example: `www.example.com`)**

1. Client asks recursive resolver: “What is `www.example.com`?”
2. If resolver cache has it and TTL not expired → return cached IP.
3. If not cached → resolver queries a root server → root responds with TLD server for `.com`.
4. Resolver asks the `.com` TLD server → TLD returns authoritative nameserver(s) for `example.com`.
5. Resolver asks authoritative nameserver → gets `A/AAAA` records for `www.example.com`.
6. Resolver returns IP to client; client connects to that IP.

**⏸️ Recursive vs Iterative queries**

* Recursive: resolver promises to return a final answer (does the full recursion).
* Iterative: server responds with a referral (e.g., “ask the TLD server”), and the requester may iterate.

**TTL & propagation**

* Each DNS record has a TTL (seconds). Caches respect TTL. When you change records, old caches may persist until TTL expires — causing “DNS propagation” delays.
* Use low TTL before big changes (but don’t leave low TTL long-term; cache benefits).

**Aliases & load balancing**

* `CNAME` chains create aliases. DNS-based load balancing often uses multiple `A` records (round-robin) or geo-DNS to return different IPs by client location.

**DNS and service discovery**

* Microservices can use service discovery systems (Consul, etcd) rather than public DNS for internal routing; internal DNS servers exist in clouds (AWS Route 53 private hosted zones, Kubernetes DNS).

**Practical commands**

* `dig +trace example.com` → shows the resolution path root → TLD → authoritative.
* `dig A example.com` → query A record.
* `dig @8.8.8.8 example.com` → ask Google DNS.
* `nslookup` (Windows) equivalent.
* `host example.com` (simple).

**Security & DNS**

* DNS spoofing/cache poisoning: mitigated by DNSSEC (signing DNS records).
* Use HTTPS and TLS (DNS can point to IPs but confidentiality needs TLS).

# Anycast Routing (deep)

**What Anycast is (tl;dr)**
Anycast: multiple servers in different locations advertise the *same* IP address to the Internet routing system (BGP). The network routes the client to the “nearest” instance according to BGP path selection — client ends up talking to the geographically/ topologically closest server advertising that IP.

**How it’s implemented**

* Multiple data centers run the same service (e.g., DNS, CDN edge) and each one announces the same IP prefix via BGP to its upstream ISPs.
* Internet routers choose the best (shortest/lowest-cost) path to that IP; thus traffic goes to the nearest instance.

**Use cases**

* CDNs (CloudFront, Cloudflare): bring cached content close to users.
* Public DNS resolvers (Google DNS, Cloudflare) use anycast so queries hit a nearby server.
* DDoS mitigation — traffic can be absorbed/distributed across many points of presence.

**Benefits**

* Lower latency — users reach a nearby edge.
* High availability — if one POP (point of presence) fails, BGP withdraws the prefix and traffic moves to others.
* Simple from client perspective: same IP everywhere, no DNS changes needed.

**Drawbacks & caveats**

* **Stateful connections**: anycast is great for stateless or cache-oriented services (HTTP GETs, DNS). For stateful TCP sessions, routing a subsequent packet to a different POP can break the session. Workarounds: session affinity, client stickiness, or keep sessions within an edge via other mechanisms (cookies, consistent hashing, overlay networks).
* **Routing unpredictability**: BGP decisions are based on policies and topology, not strict geographic proximity. “Nearest” is network-topology-nearest, not always geographically nearest.
* **Complexity in TLS termination**: a given TLS session needs consistent certificates and keys across POPs; usually they replicate certs and keys or use key management.
* **Troubleshooting**: debugging is harder because the same IP hits different locations; use traceroutes and ask upstream AS paths.

**How CDNs combine anycast + DNS**

* Some CDNs use anycast for initial routing to an edge, then HTTP redirects or internal DNS/geo-DNS logic to pick an optimal cache node. Many CDNs combine techniques for best performance.

**Practical checks / commands**

* `traceroute 1.1.1.1` (or `tracert` on Windows) to see path to an anycast IP — you may see different hops from different locations.
* Query a Global DNS (1.1.1.1) from different networks and compare RTTs; you'll likely hit different POPs.

# Practical Exercises and Mini-Labs (do these now)

1. **Check your IPs**

   * `ip addr` (Linux/macOS) or `ipconfig` (Windows) → identify private IP.
   * `curl ifconfig.me` → see public IP.

2. **Run and expose a simple server**

   * `python -m http.server 8080` then test local access.
   * Set up port forwarding on your router (or use `ssh -R`/ngrok) to access externally — observe NAT behavior.

3. **DNS trace**

   * `dig +trace github.com` → follow the resolution path, inspect TTLs and authoritative servers.

4. **Anycast observation**

   * `traceroute 1.1.1.1` and `traceroute 8.8.8.8` from different networks (home vs mobile) and compare hop counts / first few ASes.

5. **TTL experiment**

   * Create/change a DNS record (if you own a domain) with a short TTL and observe how long caches persist after change.

# Quick checklist for what to remember

* Public IP = globally routeable; private IP = local network only. NAT maps private→public.
* DNS resolves names → IPs using a hierarchical distributed system (root → TLD → authoritative). TTL controls caching and propagation.
* Anycast = same IP announced from many places via BGP; great for low-latency, stateless services (CDN, DNS), but has trade-offs for stateful sessions.
