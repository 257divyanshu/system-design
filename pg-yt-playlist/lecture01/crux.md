## üß† 1. Summary of Your Notes (Simplified Overview)

You‚Äôre designing a **large-scale e-commerce system** (like Amazon) ‚Äî learning how to handle massive traffic, ensure uptime, and optimize performance.

### **A. Client‚ÄìServer Basics**

* A **server** is a machine that runs 24√ó7 and has a **public IP address** so clients can connect to it.
* Cloud providers (AWS, DigitalOcean) rent out such servers (virtual machines).
* Remembering IPs is hard ‚Üí **DNS** translates domain names to IPs (DNS resolution).

### **B. Scaling the System**

* **Vertical scaling:** Increase machine resources (CPU, RAM).
  ‚û§ Downsides: downtime + hardware limits.
* **Horizontal scaling:** Add more machines.
  ‚û§ Needs **load balancing** to distribute traffic across multiple servers.

### **C. Load Balancing**

* Load balancer gets registered in DNS.
* Balances traffic using algorithms (e.g., **Round Robin**).
* AWS term: **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.

### **D. Microservices & API Gateway**

* Each microservice has its own servers and load balancers.
* **API Gateway** routes requests to the right microservice based on endpoint.
* Can integrate **authentication** at the gateway level.

### **E. Background Processing (Async Jobs)**

* Long-running jobs (e.g., sending emails) shouldn‚Äôt block main services.
* Use **worker services** + **queue systems (FIFO)** for async processing.
* Queue systems decouple services and allow scalability.
* AWS term: **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**.

### **F. Pub/Sub Architecture**

* When one event (e.g., payment) triggers multiple actions (notify customer, vendor, etc.).
* **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** notifies multiple consumers at once.
* **Pub/Sub** = event-driven model.

  * Advantage: Multiple consumers get notified.
  * Disadvantage: No built-in acknowledgment/retry mechanism.

### **G. Fan-Out Architecture**

* Combine SNS + multiple SQS queues.
* Each queue has multiple consumers; failed tasks can retry.
* Solves the acknowledgment problem of pure pub/sub.

### **H. Rate Limiting**

* Protect servers from abuse (fake or excessive requests).
* Use **token bucket** or **leaky bucket** algorithms.

### **I. Database Scaling**

* A single database can be overwhelmed by many microservices.
* Use **replication**: one **primary (write)** node + multiple **read replicas**.
* Use **read replicas** for analytics/logs (delay acceptable).
* Reduces load on the primary DB.

### **J. Caching**

* Use **Redis (in-memory DB)** to cache frequently accessed or computed data.
* Reduces load on the database, speeds up response.

### **K. CDN (Content Delivery Network)**

* Place **CDN (e.g., CloudFront)** before the load balancer to cache content geographically closer to users.
* **Anycast routing** ensures users connect to the nearest CDN edge.
* If data not in cache ‚Üí fetched from origin ‚Üí cached for next request.
